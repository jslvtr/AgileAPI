#Tools

For our project we wanted to experiment with new technologies but also stick with technologies which we are all used to. The tools that used in our project are:

- **NodeJS**
  - Used for the API
- **AngularJS**
  - Client side web app

#So why did we choose them?
##NodeJS
The original idea that we had was that we could build a desktop application similar [Atom](https://atom.io/)
