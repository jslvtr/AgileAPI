This is a new blog. I thought of starting a blog for a while now, for fun maybe.

But I wasn't comfortable with how generic blogs look today.
Most blog hosting services are nice, and most are even socially connected like tumblr.
But I guess i felt like tumblr was being too slow, and custom themes to choose from
are quite limited. There is ofcourse that option to customize your own page. But I feel that would be too much work.

There are plenty of others to consider as well, blogspot, wordpress and a lot more. I tried blogspot before, but well it's the same with tumblr. I admit, wordpress isn't so bad. Still there was something I didn't like. Maybe because it was too simple for me?


Anyways after a while, I found out about jekyll, first from smashingmagazine.com
LINK --> [Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages) 

Static pages for your blog. It's what reeled me in. I didn't need to worry about hosting and other stuff. 

Setting up github pages --- > EASY
Choosing a forkable theme of Jekyll ---> EASY
Locally developing Jekyll using Windows ---> NOT THE BEST CHOICE.


Let me clear things up first. Jekyll is in fact Cross-Platform. But there was a problem with the 2.5.0 version with windows, And it was fixed with 2.5.1. Which I waited for a couple of days for a fix. Although i could've had the alternative of downgrading to 2.4.0, Just that the jekyll theme I wanted had problems building with 2.4.0.

I wanted a simple and clean look to my blog, just like most modern websites. I ended up
with using "Clean Blog" theme thanks to Start Bootstrap. And things are finally up and running.


I still need to work on changing images and other details ofcourse. But that can be done later. Setting up this blog has sidetracked me from work, because of the complications i encountered.


#Some stuff I want to add/change.
  - <s>Add commenting probably with DISQUS since it supports Jekyll.</s>
  - <s>Change the way posts are shown at home page, and show a brief preview.</s
  - Change header images on the entire site.
  - Change to a custom URL
