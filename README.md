#A blog.
A blog created with the forked version
of the jekyll theme "Clean Blog" by Start Bootstrap.


Took me a couple of days to figure out jekyll especially
with the 2.5.0 breakage on windows platforms.

It's finally fixed on 2.5.1 recent update, but some themes are still broken with it.

The Clean Blog theme works perfectly and smoothly without issues, after the jekyll 2.5.1 release.
